Task for Freadom's AI Internship

I've enhanced the existing "Record and Speak" feature by adding real-time speech-to-text conversion using Whisper and tracking user input throughout the story. After completing the story, users receive a report on their speech accuracy and timing. Hence, analysis of the progress can be done while the user enjoys the learning process.

I have used Whisper and deployed on Streamlit.

I have other creative ideas as well, such as giving the end user the opportunity to create a story. He/she speaks and it gets converted to for example the recent trend ghibli images or maybe we can create a tree where a story can lead to many possibilities at various points, the user decides where to go. I have my end semester exams going on, hence was able to do this in the time constraint. 

I would love the opportunity to discuss other ideas as well! Thankyou for your time and consideration.
