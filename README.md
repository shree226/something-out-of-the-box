Task for Freadom's AI Internship

The website already has a feature known as record and speak. I have added a further functionality where we can keep a record of what the user has said throughout the story and then provide a report to it which includes accuracy and time precision.I have taken this story's pictures from the site itself. The user gets a creative experience as it's voice gets recorded, and gets converted from speech to text in real time using Whisper, while enjoying the story. At the end of story, you get a report of the accuracy and time precision of the user. Hence, analysis of the progress of the user can be done while making learning an enjoyable process.

I have used Whisper and deployed on Streamlit.

I have other creative ideas as well, such as giving the end user the opportunity to create a story. He/she speaks and it gets converted to for example the recent trend ghibli images or maybe we can create a tree where a story can lead to many possibilities at various points, the user decides where to go. I have my end semester exams going on, hence was able to do this in the time constraint. 

I would love the opportunity to discuss other ideas as well! Thankyou for your time and consideration.
